        A few days ago, Lowko (a Starcraft youtuber who produces content on some other games) posted a <a href="https://youtu.be/SsK3h_hea3M">video</a> of him playing the last of us for the first time. I’ve played and finished the game since it’s out and was curious to see his reaction to the end of the intro.

        After watching him react pretty much as expected, I remembered this video from Mark Brown (a cool youtuber who makes video essays on game design). The video compares the last of us and the last guardian, especially how they treat the relationship between the characters and tell their story. The last of us does it mostly via cut scenes and the last guardian utilizes game play to achieve it.

This is something I’ve thought about quite a lot and my 2 cents on the matter is that using cut-scenes to tell your story in a video game simply shows a bad understanding of the medium. Not that you can’t make great cut-scene-based games, The Last of Us is definitely a great game but in my opinion, it could have been even better.

Another thing I’ve had in mind for quite some time is making “short games”, basically the equivalent of short movies but for games. Games that you could finish in 15-60 minutes that would allow me to experiment with storytelling in the video game medium.

Except I’m no good at writing stories so this never happened.

Hence this little project. The story being already written this would be perfect.

### Key points of the project:

- Re-interpret every cut scene of the intro with 100% game play, no cut-scene allowed, the player has to be in control from beginning to end (unless there’s a valid reason for him not to be).
- Probably reinterpret the actual game play based on the changes I make for the cut scenes, for a more seamless experience.
- The player should get the same feels from the reinterpretation than from the cut scenes, plus a greater sense of involvement. He should be living the story instead of watching it.

### Disclaimer:

I’m by no mean a game designer and I don’t pretend to be.
I’m just a guy who loves video games and spent a fair amount of time thinking about game-design, especially how it can impact story-telling.
